Untested
--------
- Floating-Point variables and/or values
- All operations (=,+,-) on all variable types (solution isn't very well desinged: copied for-loops. change when removing if-else structure)

Not implemented but planned
---------------
- Multithreaded (Sub)programs
- Multicontroller support (IOWrap-Library is very rudimentary for now)
- New Structure for roObject-Class: Every Item Type has its own class, functions etc
  elliminate the huge if-else-structure

Not working
-----------
- backpropagation of data wires. (e.g. two "right"-command boxes connected to the same variable)
- "passthrough"-subprograms which are called by data-wires and not in a flow-thing
- different languages (especially Pin-Names like "J" and "N" for "Ja" and "Nein". Maybe the document-language can be found in the main-metadata-block?)
