Untested
--------
- Floating-Point variables and/or values
- All operations (=,+,-) on all variable types (solution isn't very well desinged: copied for-loops. change when removing if-else structure)

Not implemented but planned
---------------
- Multithreaded (Sub)programs
- Multicontroller support (IOWrap-Library is very rudimentary for now)
- New Structure for roObject-Class: Every Item Type has its own class, functions etc
  elliminate the huge if-else-structure

Not implemented in Code
---------------
- ftProDataOutSngl Non-classic-Mode
- ftProFlowWaitChange Non-classic-Mode
- IOWrap: setSensorType - don't know if already used in code
- IOWrap: setOutputType - don't know either

Not working
-----------
- backpropagation of data wires. (e.g. two "right"-command boxes connected to the same variable)
- "passthrough"-subprograms which are called by data-wires and not in a flow-thing
- different languages -> Maybe the document-language can be found in the main-metadata-block?)
  - Pin-Names like "J" and "N" for "Ja" and "Nein"
  - Name of "Hauptprogramm" as the startpoint (maybe look for an main-program-identifier as well)
