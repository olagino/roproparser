- Data-transmission on data-wires does not work properly because of some general
problems with the programs logic structure. When input values are missing, the
Block tries to backpropagate its values on the logical chain but this may not be
successful every time.
- The structure isnt' very easy to understand and maintain. The generation of
pseudo elements to simulate converging wires isn't a very nice solution.
- The program structure is extremely unflexible, especially in the roObject-Class.
To improve that type-Specific roObject-Classes may be helpful, inheriting the nor-
mal roObject-Class. At the moment it is only able to interpret the object-structure
in the rpp-files in real time. It is not able to compile the structure into some
other kind of programming language to run in standalone mode. This would allow a
much better performance.
