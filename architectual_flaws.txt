- Data-transmission on data-wires does not work properly because of some general
problems with the programs logic structure. When input values are missing, the
Block tries to backpropagate its values on the logical chain but this may not be
successful every time.
- The structure isnt' very easy to understand and maintain. The generation of
pseudo elements to simulate converging wires isn't a very nice solution.
