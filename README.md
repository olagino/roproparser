This is a weird collection of slightly object-orientated pieces of software to
parse and interpret and execute RoboPro-XML-Files primarily with ftrobopy.
At the moment it doesn't support a lot of elements since its a very very first
beta.
The documentation isn't that good, although I try to keep my mess under control.
